When a client (i.e., a web browser) requests a webpage, the order in which files are downloaded depends on how the HTML document references those files and the browser’s behavior. Here’s a breakdown of the typical process:

1. **HTML File**: The browser requests the HTML file first. This is because the URL you enter in the address bar of the browser points to an HTML file, which serves as the starting point for the page.
2. **Parsing the HTML**: As the browser starts to receive the HTML file, it begins parsing it. During this process, it encounters references to CSS and JavaScript files.
3. **CSS Files**: When the browser encounters a `<link>` tag referencing a CSS file in the `<head>` section, it requests and downloads the CSS file. CSS files are usually prioritized because the browser needs them to correctly render the page’s layout and styles. The browser continues parsing the HTML while it fetches the CSS files, but it may not render the page until the CSS is fully downloaded and applied.
4. **JavaScript Files**:

   - **Synchronous (Blocking) Scripts**: If the browser encounters a `<script>` tag that does not have the `defer` or `async` attributes, it will treat the script as blocking. This means the browser will stop parsing the HTML and wait until the JavaScript file is downloaded and executed before continuing.
   - **Asynchronous Scripts (`async` attribute)**: If a `<script>` tag has the `async` attribute, the browser will download the JavaScript file in parallel with the rest of the page and execute it as soon as it’s downloaded, without waiting for the HTML parsing to complete.
   - **Deferred Scripts (`defer` attribute)**: If a `<script>` tag has the `defer` attribute, the browser will download the JavaScript file in parallel but defer execution until after the HTML document is fully parsed.

In JavaScript, the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords are used to declare variables, but they differ in terms of scope, hoisting, and mutability. Here’s a detailed comparison:

### `var`

**Scope:**

- `var` is function-scoped. This means that a variable declared with `var` is accessible within the function it is declared in, or globally if declared outside any function.
- If `var` is declared within a block (e.g., within a loop or an if statement), it is accessible outside of that block.

**Hoisting:**

- Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. However, they are initialized with `undefined`.
- This means you can reference a `var` variable before its declaration, but its value will be `undefined` until the declaration is encountered.

**Example:**

javascript

Copy code

`console.log(x); // undefined var x = 5; console.log(x); // 5`

### `let`

**Scope:**

- `let` is block-scoped. This means a variable declared with `let` is only accessible within the block (e.g., `{}`) it is declared in.
- It provides better control over variable scope compared to `var`.

**Hoisting:**

- Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. Accessing them before the declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

**Example:**

javascript

Copy code

`console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization let y = 10; console.log(y); // 10`

### `const`

**Scope:**

- Like `let`, `const` is block-scoped. It is only accessible within the block it is declared in.

**Hoisting:**

- Variables declared with `const` are hoisted but not initialized, similar to `let`. Accessing them before the declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

**Mutability:**

- A variable declared with `const` cannot be reassigned. However, if the variable is an object or array, the contents of the object or array can still be modified.

**Example:**

javascript

Copy code

`const z = 15; console.log(z); // 15 z = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.  const obj = { a: 1 }; obj.a = 2; // This is allowed console.log(obj.a); // 2`

### Summary

- **`var`:** Function-scoped, hoisted, can be redeclared and reassigned.
- **`let`:** Block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized, can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.
- **`const`:** Block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized, cannot be reassigned or redeclared in the same scope, though properties of objects it references can be changed.

### Best Practices

- **Use `let` and `const`** instead of `var` to avoid issues with hoisting and to keep the variable scope more predictable and manageable.
- **Use `const` by default**, unless you know you need to reassign the variable. This can help prevent unintended changes to variables.

Understanding these differences can help write cleaner and more maintainable JavaScript code.

### Falsy Values

Falsy values are those that are considered false when encountered in a Boolean context. There are exactly six falsy values in JavaScript:

1. **`false`**: The Boolean value false.
2. **`0`**: The number zero.
3. **`-0`**: Negative zero.
4. **`""`**: An empty string (a string with no characters).
5. **`null`**: Represents the absence of any object value.
6. **`undefined`**: Indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value.
7. **`NaN`**: Stands for "Not-a-Number".

Any value not listed above is considered truthy.

### Truthy Values

Truthy values are those that are considered true when encountered in a Boolean context. Essentially, any value that is not falsy is truthy. Here are some examples of truthy values:

1. **`true`**: The Boolean value true.
2. **Any non-zero number**: e.g., `1`, `-1`, `42`.
3. **Non-empty strings**: e.g., `"hello"`, `"false"`, `"0"`.
4. **Objects**: e.g., `{}`, `[]`.
5. **Symbols**: e.g., `Symbol()`.
6. **Functions**: e.g., `function() {}`.
